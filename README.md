# N-Queen_Solver
A C++ implementation of the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The program efficiently finds all possible solutions for placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. The solution ensures that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.
